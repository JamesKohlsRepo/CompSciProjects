-Created by: James Kohls for Professor Pang's CSE 30 class, Programming Abstractions
This program simulates an infection disease and models community spread, users input their own parameters and can simulate their disease as is spreads
While we were instructed to create the simulation with dots, I expanded on the idea by making the disease controllable, and giving the balls set starting 
locations they will return to once becoming symptomatic. 

Designed to be run In Pycharm or any other Pyton IDE, PNG images should be placed with .py files
